# Drum Machine

#### Description: Drum machine with two banks and volume control. Tools used: React, CSS, HTML.

I designed a drum machine that has two banks, with a switch, and a volume control slider. It has nine pads that can be clicked or activated by the keypad with the corresponding letter. The name of the ID also renders as a note is activated.
